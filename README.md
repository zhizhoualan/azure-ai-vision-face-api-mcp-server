## Prerequisites
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with access to the Cognitive Services Face API.
- Python 3.11 or later with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) available on your `PATH` for running the MCP server.
- (Optional) An Azure OpenAI resource with a deployed GPT-4.1 model if you plan to use open-set attribute detection.
- (Optional) Node.js 20 or later when running the HTTP bridge found in the [`bridge/`](bridge) directory.

## Running MCP Server
### Installation
#### 1. Using UV
Refer to the [Installation Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_2) for instructions on installing uv.

#### 2. Clone this project
We provide several example images in the [example](example) folder. Please clone this project to try the [example prompts](#example-prompts) below.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai-vision-face-api-mcp-server.git
```

#### 3. Set Up Azure AI Vision Face API
- Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFace) and create a new **Face** resource.
- After deployment, navigate to the resource and copy the **Endpoint URL** and one of the **Key** from the "Keys and Endpoint" section.
- You will be prompted to enter the following environment variables the first time you start the MCP server:
  - `Azure AI Face API Endpoint`: The endpoint URL of your Azure Face API deployment.
  - `Azure AI Face API Key`: The API key for your Azure Face API resource.

#### 4. (Optional) Deploy GPT-4.1 on Azure OpenAI for Open-Set Attribute Detection
- To enable open-set face attribute detection, you need access to Azure OpenAI.
- In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), create an Azure OpenAI resource and deploy a GPT-4.1 model.
- Once deployed, obtain the **Endpoint URL** and **API Key** for your OpenAI resource.
- You will be prompted to enter the following environment variables the first time you start the MCP server:
  - `Azure OpenAI Endpoint`: The endpoint URL of your Azure OpenAI deployment.
  - `Azure OpenAI API Key`: The API key for your Azure OpenAI resource.
- For more details about using , see the [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/overview).

#### 5. (Optional) Configure Azure Storage for Image Management
- To enable image management and access, you need an Azure Storage account.
- In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), create an Azure Storage resource and set up a container for your images.
- Once created, obtain your **Storage Account Name**, **Container Name**, and a **SAS Token** for secure access.
- You will be prompted to enter the following environment variables the first time you start the MCP server:
  - `AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNT`: The name of your Azure Storage account.
  - `AZURE STORAGE CONTAINER`: The name of your image container.
  - `AZURE STORAGE SAS TOKEN`: The SAS token for your storage container.
- For more details about using Azure Storage, see the [Azure Storage documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).

#### 6. Interact with our MCP tools using Visual Studio Code GitHub Copilot
- Install [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) Visual Studio Code extension.
- Rename the file `.vscode/mcp-bp.json` to `.vscode/mcp.json` (or copy `.vscode/mcp-bp.json` to your existing `.vscode/mcp.json`) and press `Start` above the `azure_ai_vision_face_api_mcp_server` in `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- Follow this [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server) to add our MCP tools in the workspace and [start a conversation with GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_use-mcp-tools-in-agent-mode) and use MCP tools in agent mode leveraging GPT-4.1.

#### 7. (Optional) Prepare Environment for Local Testing
- Before running pytest or other scripts outside of MCP, copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
- Fill in your real keys in `.env`. These keys are the same as those used in `.vscode/mcp.json`.

### Configure Credentials for CI Test Runs
To run the live Face API integration tests in GitHub Actions, add your Azure Face resource credentials as repository secrets.

Follow the detailed walkthrough in [`docs/ci-credentials.md`](docs/ci-credentials.md), or use the quick-start version below:

1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
2. Add repository secrets named `AZURE_FACE_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_FACE_API_KEY` using the values from your Azure Face resource.
3. On the next push or pull request, the CI workflow exports these secrets as environment variables so that `pytest` executes the live tests alongside the rest of the suite. If you already pushed your changes, open the **Actions → CI** page and click **Run workflow** to start a credential-enabled test run immediately.

#### 8. (Optional) MCP HTTP Bridge (Node/TypeScript)

- This repo includes a small **HTTP bridge** in the `bridge/` folder.
- The bridge launches the local **Azure Face MCP server** (via `uvx --from …`) using stdio and exposes a REST API for listing and calling MCP tools.
- It makes the MCP server usable from **OpenAI Responses API** or any web frontend.
- **Available endpoints**
  - GET /health → { ok: true }
  - GET /mcp/tools → list available MCP tools
  - POST /mcp/call → call a tool by name with arguments
**Usage**
  ```bash
  # Setup
  cd bridge
  npm install
  cp .env.example .env   # fill in your environment values (see step 7 above)
  npm run dev

  # Examples:
  # list all MCP tools
  curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp/tools
  # list all large person groups
  curl --% -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp/call -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ \"name\": \"azure_face_recognition_list_large_person_groups\", \"arguments\": {} }"
  ```

## Example Prompts
- You may be prompted to agree to use the MCP tool the first time you use each MCP tool. Please press `Continue` to proceed.
### Face Attribute Detection
1. Test the face attribute detection:
```
Check all the faces inside detection1.jpg wearing the mask or glasses
```

2. Test the open-set attribute detection:
```
Analyze the hair color and gender of all individuals in detection2.jpg
```

3. Test the attribute detection using image URL:
```
Check all the faces' age and gender inside https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/refs/heads/master/Face/images/detection4.jpg
```

### Face Image Comparison
1. Compare the similarity between two face images:
```
Compare the identification1.jpg with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/refs/heads/master/Face/images/findsimilar.jpg
```

2. Compare the similarity between one image and another image folder:
```
Compare test-image-person-group.jpg with all the images in reco/Bob" using the "most_similar" option
```

### Face Recognition
1. Test the face enrollment and identify without handling any uuid by user:
```
create a new person group and enroll all the images in the example/reco folder and check example/test-image-person-group.jpg belongs to which person with which person id. Also check the following image belongs to which person: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/refs/heads/master/Face/images/extra-woman-image.jpg
```
